# Implementing the Lottery
To run the lottery, all you have to do is enter and confirm the seed below. (It will not show results until you enter a seed and confirm it.) The actual seed will be determined by a live roll of nine 10-sided dice on Friday January 13, each single die roll becoming a digit of the integer, in order, plus one coin toss determining whether the entire number is positive or negative. The seed primes R's pseudo-random number generator so the code can run reproducibly. Before the seed is set, applicants can enter any integer they want to simulate the lottery. (Well, almost. For computer-y reasons it can be any integer with absolute value less than or equal to 2,147,483,647.)
