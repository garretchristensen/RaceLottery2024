# What are my odds?
To find your odds, first enter your previous applications, previous finishes, volunteer shifts, and extra trailwork. (The raw numbers--not any transformations.) We'll calculate your tickets. Then click [here](https://github.com/garretchristensen/RaceLottery2023/blob/main/odds.txt), and find the row for your tickets for the appropriate gender. (Sorry the pagination is not great!)
