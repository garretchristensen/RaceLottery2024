# How many tickets do I have?
To find the odds for a specific type of applicant, enter their previous applications, previous finishes, volunteer shifts, and extra trailwork. (The raw numbers--not any transformations.) We'll calculate your tickets using the chosen weighting. Then find the closest number of tickets in the table for the appropriate gender, and the corresponding odds. 

Note: you can enter combos of applications, finishes, etc. that no one applied with, so you may not find the exact ticket count in the table. Just use the closest score for the relevant gender.
